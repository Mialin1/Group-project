Topic: Mr. Bomb


## 1. Introduction of Game
The proposed game, "Mr. Bomb", is an adventure RPG game. The player can enjoy the excitement of surviving from bombs, making use of varieties of props, and collecting coins. By putting bombs to open the wooden boxes, the outcome can be helpful props, coins, or even bombs. If the player can get enough gold coins within the limited time or before death, it will get more challenging with every level, and the random bomb will occur at a higher frequency.

## 2. Rules of the Game
### 2.1 rules for survive
The player initially has one life. If the player can collect a "heart" prop, the player can add one more life. If the bomb hits the user, he will lose one life, and if the life status becomes zero, the user dies. Additionally, the bomb's lethality is the nine boxes around it, and the automated bomb can only bomb the user but will not explode the wooden boxes. After death, the game will calculate the total coin collected in this level, and if it meets the requirement for passing this level, the player can go to the next level.

### 2.2 rules for passing to next level
When the user survives from the bombs after a limited time, the game will compare the coin collected by the player with the requirement. If the number is above the condition, it will pass to the next level.

### 2.3 rules for using each game prop
1) heart: add one more life
2) shield: the player will be in invincible mode for 5 seconds
3) coin: count for the final grade
4) rocket: increase the speed of the player within the next 20 seconds
5) spring: the player is able to directly walk though the wall within the next 20 seconds
6) wood: the player can build a disposable wall which can protect itself from the bomb
7) bomb: 
  1. Placed by the user: the bomb's lethality is the nine boxes around it, but it can only explode the wooden boxes not the wall. There will be random coin, props or even bombs come out after explode the wooden boxes.
  2. the automated bomb: the bomb's lethality is the nine boxes around it. It will only hurt the uer but will not explode any other boxes.
